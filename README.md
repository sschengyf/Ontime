#Ontime

This is a hybrid APP which provides the real time of each timezone. 

Actually, this basic function is easy to be found on Internet and world clock on smart phone. 

The advanced function of APP is to display the time of each timezone when I edit the date time of any one timezone. 

For a use case, assume I am in New Zealand, there will be a remote meeting with my clients in the US a few days later, my clients tell me their preferred meeting time in the US and ask me to confirm the time, with this APP, just edit the time of US at the time which my clients provide me, then it will display the time of New Zealand at that date.
